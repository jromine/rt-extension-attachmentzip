This is an extension for Best Practical's Request Tracker
http://www.bestpractical.com/rt

This extension permits you to download the attachments associated with a ticket as a zip file.

There are two options:

1) current
2) all

Current mode downloads just the most recent revision of the attached file
All mode downloads _all_ the revisions, and prepends the revision id number to the filename.

Enjoy
